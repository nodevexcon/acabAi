/**
 * Data extraction example of using the context engine with PuppeteerAgent
 *
 * This example demonstrates how the context engine maintains complex data across multiple steps,
 * with a focus on:
 * 1. Extracting structured data from tables
 * 2. Using that data to make decisions
 * 3. Verifying data consistency across different pages
 * 4. Performing calculations based on extracted data
